## ex-scala-model-based-testing

This is a Scala implementation of the exercise in [Reliable Systems series: Model Based Testing](https://medium.com/@tylerneely/reliable-systems-series-model-based-property-testing-e89a433b360).

### Usage

`sbt` then `~testQuick` to run tests on file changes. Make changes to the
implementation and make sure the model-based test suite passes.
